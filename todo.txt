next time: make animations for both enemys and player(s)
- add loot system
- - we have already put loot descriptions in the enemy JSON file
- - loot is a list where integers are cash and strings refer to items in the item JSON
- - next job is to actually add the loot to your wallet/inventory upon victory
- - (probably do this at the end of the fight function)
